## DESCRIPTION
### OVERALL
This is AniApp. AniApp is a database of anime/manga (finished or active) that allows you to organize and sort through titles and watch trailers; making it easier to find titles that fit your interests. The interactive lounge area (when completed) is a great place to chill, listen to music and interact with other users to discuss current topics, titles, and plot lines. 
### PROFILE
The 'My Profile' section of this app allows you to view and manage personal info, change avatar image, and update bio/alias as well as viewing your friends list. The 'Users' section provides you with an up to date list of users with access to a 'User Details' page that displays name, when they joined, email, favorite anime and manga (icebox) by clicking on a respective users name.
